## Developer's Notes

Why I have chosen Next.js? In order to speed things up. I have used it before and I know how to use it. It is also very easy to deploy on Vercel. It provides routing and overall user experience like loading is smoother.

This is a very limited version of transaction explorer. In next iterations those are the thing that could be added or done better:
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Make pagination more dynamic with page numbers and page size
- [ ] Add search and filters
- [ ] Add more details to transaction page
- [ ] Add page for exploring a single transaction

Nonetheless the project was fun!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
